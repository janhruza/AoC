# AoC
This project is a collection of my solutions for the Advent of Code challenges, implemented in C#.

## About Advent of Code
Advent of Code is an annual event that provides daily programming challenges during the month of December. Each day, a new puzzle is released, and participants can solve it using any programming language they choose. The challenges range from simple tasks to complex problems, making it a great way to improve coding skills and have fun.

Advent of Code is available at [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com/).

## Use of the AI
I used AI to help me think about the given problems. Most of the code was written solely by me but some parts were AI generated.
