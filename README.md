## About Advent of Code
Advent of Code is an annual event that provides daily programming challenges during the month of December. Each day, a new puzzle is released, and participants can solve it using any programming language they choose. The challenges range from simple tasks to complex problems, making it a great way to improve coding skills and have fun.
